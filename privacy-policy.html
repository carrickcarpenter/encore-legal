<h1>Encore Coach — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 27, 2026</p>

<h2>SMS Messaging Terms</h2>
<p>By texting the Encore Coach phone number, you consent to receive AI-powered retirement life coaching responses via SMS. <strong>Message frequency varies based on your interaction.</strong> You will only receive messages in direct response to texts you send — no unsolicited messages will be sent.</p>
<p><strong>Text STOP to opt out at any time. Text HELP for support. Message and data rates may apply.</strong></p>

<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<p>When you text Encore Coach, we collect your phone number and the content of your messages solely to provide personalized retirement life coaching responses.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
<p>Your messages are processed by an AI coaching system to generate helpful responses. We do not use your data for marketing, advertising, or any purpose other than providing the coaching service.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. Messages are processed through our AI service provider (Anthropic) under their data processing terms.</p>

<h2>Advisor Engagement Reports</h2>
<p>Encore Coach is provided through your financial advisor. Your advisor may receive periodic engagement reports that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your first and last name</li>
<li>How frequently you use the service (e.g., number of sessions per week)</li>
<li>General topics you've explored (e.g., "daily routine," "social connections")</li>
<li>Whether you are actively engaged or have not used the service recently</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your actual conversations are always private.</strong> Your advisor will never see the content of your messages, your specific answers, or personal details you share during coaching sessions. Only aggregated engagement information is included in advisor reports.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Your conversation data is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption with per-user encryption keys. Directory names are hashed so that no personally identifiable information is visible on disk. Access to your data is controlled through our secure bridge layer — the AI coaching system does not have direct access to stored files.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Conversation history is retained only as long as needed to maintain coaching context. You may request deletion of your data at any time by texting STOP.</p>

<h2>Opt-Out</h2>
<p>Text <strong>STOP</strong> at any time to stop receiving messages. Text <strong>HELP</strong> for support information.</p>
